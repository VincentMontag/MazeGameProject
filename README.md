# MazeGameProject
This is a project we made for Web Engineering. It contains a Maze Game for the browser, made with JS and HTML / CSS

We want to create a Browsergame that firstly builds up a random generated maze and lets you navigate with 10 different player through it.
If you are not quick enough, the maze gets automatically changed and you have to find another way out.
Every maze that gets generated is 100% solvable. If you have the "luck" to get stuck, you have 2 bonus steps that allow you to step through walls.
Your player model is a car with 10 different colors you can choose from (each player gets another color).
Navigation is possible via arrow-keys on your keyboard.

I hope you are interested in this project we are doing! :)
