# MazeGameProject
This is a project we made for Web Engineering. It contains a Maze Game for the browser, made with JS and HTML / CSS

We want to create a Browsergame that firstly builds up a random generated maze and lets you navigate with 10 different player through it.
If you are not quick enough, the maze gets automatically changed and you have to find another way out.
Every maze that gets generated is 100% solvable so don't worry about getting stuck for a whole rotation.
Your player model is a car with 10 different colors you can choose from (each player gets another color).
Navigation is possible via arrow-keys on your keyboard.
We also want to implement different kinds of modes like a hunting mode, where you have to flee from an enemy car (could look like a police car, no concrete illustration yet), the normal maze escape mode and maybe some more modes that we haven't thought about depending on our time and the effort it takes.
In addition to that, we plan to implement multiplayer sessions so you could play with 5 player the maze escape mode and with 5 other people the hunting mode.
There are also 3 difficulty options (easy, medium, hard) that change how many tiles there are for the width and the height.
Theese difficulty options will also be available when you want to start or join a session.

I hope you are interested in this project we're doing! :)
